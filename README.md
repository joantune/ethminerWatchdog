# Ethminer Watchdog

This currently relies on an NVIDIA with the power limit set to 75W

To use, make sure you edit the limit variable on `minerWatchdog.sh` and your ethminer command on supervisord.conf

Install supervisord (http://supervisord.org/installing.html)

and then run:

`supervisord` on the same directory
